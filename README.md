# Instructions

1. Clone the git repository (git clone https://github.com/2021-SIT-AdvancedAlgorithms/PA2_Closest_Pair) in your workspace.
1. Implement `kernel.c` and `kernel.h` if necessary.
1. Compile the project using `make` command.
1. You can test your program with your own input using `./closest-pair <n|daq> <1d|2d|3d>` command.

# Competition
1. Competition will be based on finding the closest pair of points in **2D** space by **divide and conquer** algorithm. Number of points will be **99999**
1. `make competition` command will be used for competition.
1. Obviously, your program must correctly find the closest pair in the first place.
